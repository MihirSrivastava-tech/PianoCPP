# PianoCPP

It is a library to play piano notes just by calling the required piano notes in the form of functions.
- Just include **notes.h** in your cpp file. 

## For calling simple notes use
> note_name(time,sleep)

>  time: duration in milliseconds to play the required frequency

>  sleep: duration in milliseconds to play the second note after the current note

## Example
> F4(550,300); F4S(400,500);
